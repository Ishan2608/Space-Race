# Space Race Analysis Project

## Overview
This project explores the history of the space race, focusing on the competition between the United States and the Soviet Union (USSR) during the Cold War era. Using a dataset containing information about space missions from 1957 to 2020, the project analyzes various aspects of the space race, including launch trends, mission success rates, and dominant players over time.
